## Summary

By looking at the data there is reason to beleive that a bias does not exist between paid (Vine) and unpaid (non-Vine) reviews. 37.19% of the Vine reviews were five star while 53.23% of the non-Vine reviews were five star. 

To further this analysis, we could also include the ratings from one star through four stars to see if that trend continues to hold true. Are Vine reviewers easier or harder on the product if they are not up to five star standards? How do non-Vine reviewers fare?
